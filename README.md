This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Router v6 where a catch-all route (`/*`) interferes with other routes, especially when nested routes are involved. The problem arises because the catch-all route is always matched, regardless of whether other more specific routes match first. The solution shows how to refactor the routes to ensure correct matching order and prevent the catch-all route from unexpectedly taking precedence.
